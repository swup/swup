## Overview

Swup is a library that helps you add page transitions to server-side rendered websites. It handles
the complete lifecycle of a page visit by intercepting link clicks, loading the new page in the
background, replacing the content and transitioning between the old and the new page.

Its goal is to make adding transitions to a site as simple as possible, while providing lots of
other quality-of-life improvements.
