## Overview

Swup adds **page transitions** to server-rendered websites. It manages the complete page load lifecycle
and smoothly animates between the current and next page. In addition, it offers many other
quality-of-life improvements like **caching**, **smart preloading**, native **browser history** and
enhanced **accessibility**.

Make your site feel like a snappy single-page app — without any of the complexity.

## Features

- ✏️ Works out of the box with [minimal markup](https://swup.js.org/getting-started/example/)
- ✨ Auto-detects [CSS transitions](https://swup.js.org/getting-started/how-it-works/) & animations for perfect timing
- 🔗 Updates URLs and preserves native [browser history](https://swup.js.org/options/#animatehistorybrowsing)
- 🏓 Manages the scroll position between pages and anchor links
- 🚀 Uses a [cache](https://swup.js.org/api/cache/) to speed up subsequent page loads
- 📡 Offers [hooks](https://swup.js.org/hooks/) to customize and extend the page load lifecycle
- 🔌 Has a powerful [plugin system](https://swup.js.org/plugins/) and many official and third-party plugins
- 🎨 Provides ready-to-go [themes](https://swup.js.org/themes/) to get started quickly

- Update [meta tags and stylesheets](https://swup.js.org/plugins/head-plugin/) after page loads
- Add support for [preloading pages](https://swup.js.org/plugins/preload-plugin/) in the background
- Improve [accessibility](https://swup.js.org/plugins/a11y-plugin/) for screen readers
- Perform your [animations in JS](https://swup.js.org/plugins/js-plugin/) instead of CSS transitions
- Animate [form submissions](https://swup.js.org/plugins/forms-plugin/)
